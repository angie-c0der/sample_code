## Problem Statement

Many of us face a problem while sorting replies to certain questions(eg: how many are coming for the IV)
posted in social media platforms (like WhatsApp).Many a times we
have thought of an app that provides data of all those who replied or reacted to the particular question.Even if we try to
segregate messages and replies, certain other messages may interrupt in between.This results in a waste of time as well as productivity.
## Solution

- It displays the replies of questions posted on WhatsApp
- It shows the count of how many people replied
- It displays the responses as well as the people who responded
- It helps in saving time and increases productivity
- No person who responded will be neglected
- It provides people the opportunity to save, download and delete the data collected
